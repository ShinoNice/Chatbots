    "2. **Split:** Text splitters break large Documents into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won't fit in a model's finite context window.\n",
    "3. **Store:** We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a VectorStore and Embeddings model.\n",

    "4. **Retrieve:** Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a Retriever.\n",
