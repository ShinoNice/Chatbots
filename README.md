# Lisbon Tourism Chatbots

This repository contains a series of chatbots developed to compare the performance and responses of different chatbot architectures in answering tourism-related questions about Lisbon. The project culminates in the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot, which leverages web-scraped data from various Lisbon tourism websites.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project was to build a chatbot tailored for tourism in Lisbon using a RAG model, which is enhanced by an external knowledge base composed of web-scraped data from sources like Visit Lisboa, Metro Lisboa, Comboios de Portugal, and Carris. The RAG chatbot was designed to provide accurate and relevant answers to questions about Lisbon, such as recommendations and information about local events and transport.

To compare and contrast the performance of the RAG chatbot, other chatbots were created:

1. **Rule-Based Chatbot**: A simple, stateless chatbot that relies on predefined rules to respond to questions.
2. **Generative Chatbot**: A more advanced chatbot capable of generating answers without relying on specific data, first implemented in a stateless version and later in a stateful version to maintain context over a conversation.

### Project Structure

- **/notebooks**: Contains the main development notebooks:
  - `RB_Chatbot.ipynb`: Simple implementation of the Rule-Based chatbot.
  - `G_Chatbots.ipynb`: Development of the stateless and stateful generative chatbots.
  - `RAG.ipynb`: Final notebook containing the implementation of the RAG chatbot.
  
- **/data**: Contains the web-scraped data used for the RAG chatbot's knowledge base.
  
- **/evaluation**: Scripts and results related to the evaluation of each chatbot's performance on a set of Lisbon tourism-related questions.

### Key Components

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: The web-scraped data was first explored and then preprocessed to improve the quality and relevance of the responses generated by the RAG chatbot.

- **RAG Pipeline**: The core of the project, the RAG pipeline, was implemented to embed the knowledge base into a vector database, which was then used to retrieve and augment prompts during user interactions.

- **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully crafted system and user prompts were developed following best practices in prompt engineering to maximize the effectiveness of each chatbot.

- **Evaluation**: The chatbots were evaluated using a set of predefined questions related to tourism in Lisbon. The RAG chatbot's performance was compared against the rule-based and generative chatbots to demonstrate the advantages of using a RAG approach with an external knowledge base.

### Usage

To run any of the chatbots or explore the development process, simply open the relevant notebook in Jupyter and follow the instructions provided. The notebooks are designed to be self-contained, with explanations and code to guide you through the chatbot creation process.

### Conclusion

This project highlights the benefits of using a RAG model for domain-specific chatbot applications, especially when dealing with a wealth of external knowledge. The comparison with simpler models further underscores the advantages of using a more sophisticated approach like RAG in providing accurate and contextually relevant information.
